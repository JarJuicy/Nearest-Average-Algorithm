# Nearest-Average-Algorithm
This is a machine learning algorithm I developed on Repl.it

# How Does It Work?
In this algorithm, the train() function takes in a dictionary of tuples, representing the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates. the predict() function takes three arugments, the input x-coordinate, n, and K. What this algorithm does it that it takes in the input x-coordinate, find the n number of points that is within K distance away from the input, take those coordinates' y-coordinates, and finally calculate the average of the y-coordinates of those points and return it.
